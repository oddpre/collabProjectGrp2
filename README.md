Collaborative Project.

To run the project:
Install XAMPP and unzip the project into: 
C:/xampp/htdocs

Then we can access the site locally, from localhost/Employee-main once the XAMPP server has been booted up.

On the browser after the server has been started, type this in:
localhost/Employee-main



login in with "admin", "adm123".
